developerworks-vim
==================

A VIM plugin for writing with the IBM developerWorks XML schema

I'd be lying if I said I had any idea what I was doing. I've written almost 30 articles for IBM developerWorks and as I go along I try to automate some of the repetitive tasks. Recently I threw out a bunch of what I had done using VIM abbreviations and redid it with mappings. It has been working well so far.

If you use this please note that it's subject to change for the better or worse. Please drop me a line (sean at ertw.com) if you do use it.
